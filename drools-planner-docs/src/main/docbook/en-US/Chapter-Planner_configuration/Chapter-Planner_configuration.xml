    <section>
      <title>Solver configuration by XML file</title>

      <para>You can build a <literal>Solver</literal> instance with the <literal>XmlSolverConfigurer</literal>.
      Configure it with a solver configuration XML file:</para>

      <programlisting language="java">        XmlSolverConfigurer configurer = new XmlSolverConfigurer();
        configurer.configure("/org/drools/planner/examples/nqueens/solver/nqueensSolverConfig.xml");
        Solver solver = configurer.buildSolver();</programlisting>

      <para>A solver configuration file looks something like this:</para>

      <programlisting language="xml">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;solver&gt;
  &lt;!-- Define the model --&gt;
  &lt;solutionClass&gt;org.drools.planner.examples.nqueens.domain.NQueens&lt;/solutionClass&gt;
  &lt;planningEntityClass&gt;org.drools.planner.examples.nqueens.domain.Queen&lt;/planningEntityClass&gt;

  &lt;!-- Define the score function --&gt;
  &lt;scoreDrl&gt;/org/drools/planner/examples/nqueens/solver/nQueensScoreRules.drl&lt;/scoreDrl&gt;
  &lt;scoreDefinition&gt;
    &lt;scoreDefinitionType&gt;SIMPLE&lt;/scoreDefinitionType&gt;
  &lt;/scoreDefinition&gt;

  &lt;!-- Configure the optimization algorithm(s) --&gt;
  &lt;termination&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/termination&gt;
  &lt;constructionHeuristic&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/constructionHeuristic&gt;
  &lt;localSearch&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/localSearch&gt;
&lt;/solver&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>Notice the 3 parts in it:</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>Configure the optimization algorithm(s)</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>We 'll explain these various parts of a configuration later in this manual.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Drools Planner makes it relatively easy to switch optimization algorithm(s) just by
      changing the configuration.</emphasis> There's even a <literal>Benchmark</literal> utility which allows you to
      play out different configurations against each other and report the most appropriate configuration for your
      problem. You could for example play out tabu search versus simulated annealing, on 4 queens and 64 queens.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Solver configuration by Java API</title>

      <para>As an alternative to the XML file, a solver configuration can also be configured with the
      <literal>SolverConfig</literal> API:</para>

      <programlisting>        SolverConfig solverConfig = new SolverConfig();

        solverConfig.setSolutionClass(NQueens.class);
        Set&lt;Class&lt;?&gt;&gt; planningEntityClassSet = new HashSet&lt;Class&lt;?&gt;&gt;();
        planningEntityClassSet.add(Queen.class);
        solverConfig.setPlanningEntityClassSet(planningEntityClassSet);

        solverConfig.setScoreDrlList(
                Arrays.asList("/org/drools/planner/examples/nqueens/solver/nQueensScoreRules.drl"));
        ScoreDefinitionConfig scoreDefinitionConfig = solverConfig.getScoreDefinitionConfig();
        scoreDefinitionConfig.setScoreDefinitionType(
                ScoreDefinitionConfig.ScoreDefinitionType.SIMPLE);

        TerminationConfig terminationConfig = solverConfig.getTerminationConfig();
        // ...
        List&lt;SolverPhaseConfig&gt; solverPhaseConfigList = new ArrayList&lt;SolverPhaseConfig&gt;();
        ConstructionHeuristicSolverPhaseConfig constructionHeuristicSolverPhaseConfig
                = new ConstructionHeuristicSolverPhaseConfig();
        // ...
        solverPhaseConfigList.add(constructionHeuristicSolverPhaseConfig);
        LocalSearchSolverPhaseConfig localSearchSolverPhaseConfig = new LocalSearchSolverPhaseConfig();
        // ...
        solverPhaseConfigList.add(localSearchSolverPhaseConfig);
        solverConfig.setSolverPhaseConfigList(solverPhaseConfigList);
        Solver solver = solverConfig.buildSolver();</programlisting>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">It is highly recommended to configure by XML file instead of this API.</emphasis> To
      dynamically configure a value at runtime, use the XML file as a template and extract the
      <literal>SolverConfig</literal> class with <literal>getSolverConfig()</literal> to configure the dynamic value at
      runtime:</para>

      <programlisting>        XmlSolverConfigurer configurer = new XmlSolverConfigurer();
        configurer.configure("/org/drools/planner/examples/nqueens/solver/nqueensSolverConfig.xml");

        SolverConfig solverConfig = configurer.getSolverConfig();
        solverConfig.getTerminationConfig().setMaximumMinutesSpend(userInput);
        Solver solver = solverConfig.buildSolver();</programlisting>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Model your planning problem</title>

    <section>
      <title>Is this class a problem fact or planning entity?</title>

      <para>Look at a dataset of your planning problem. You 'll recognize domain classes in there, each of which is one
      of these:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>A unrelated class: not used by any of the score constraints. From a planning standpoint, this data is
          obsolete.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>A <emphasis role="bold">problem fact</emphasis> class: used by the score constraints, but does NOT
          change during planning (as long as the problem stays the same). For example: <literal>Bed</literal>,
          <literal>Room</literal>, <literal>Shift</literal>, <literal>Employee</literal>, <literal>Topic</literal>,
          <literal>Period</literal>, ...</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>A <emphasis role="bold">planning entity</emphasis> class: used by the score constraints and changes
          during planning. For example: <literal>BedDesignation</literal>, <literal>ShiftAssignment</literal>,
          <literal>Exam</literal>, ...</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Ask yourself: <emphasis>What class changes during planning?</emphasis> <emphasis>Which class has variables
      that I want the <literal>Solver</literal> to choose for me?</emphasis> That class is a planning entity. Most use
      cases have only 1 planning entity class.</para>

      <note>
        <para>In <link linkend="realTimePlanning">real-time planning</link>, problem facts can change during planning,
        because the problem itself changes. However, that doesn't make them planning entities.</para>
      </note>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">In Drools Planner all problems facts and planning entities are plain old JavaBeans
      (POJO's).</emphasis> You can load them from a database (JDBC/JPA/JDO), an XML file, a data repository, a noSQL
      cloud, ...: Drools Planner doesn't care.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Problem fact</title>

      <para>A problem fact is any JavaBean (POJO) with getters that does not change during planning. Implementing the
      interface <literal>Serializable</literal> is recommended (but not required). For example in n queens, the columns
      and rows are problem facts:</para>

      <programlisting>public class Column implements Serializable {

    private int index;

    // ... getters
}</programlisting>

      <programlisting>public class Row implements Serializable {

    private int index;

    // ... getters
}</programlisting>

      <para>A problem fact can reference other problem facts of course:</para>

      <programlisting>public class Course implements Serializable {

    private String code;

    private Teacher teacher; // Other problem fact
    private int lectureSize;
    private int minWorkingDaySize;

    private List&lt;Curriculum&gt; curriculumList; // Other problem facts
    private int studentSize;

    // ... getters
}</programlisting>

      <para>A problem fact class does <emphasis>not</emphasis> require any Planner specific code. For example, you can
      reuse your domain classes, which might have JPA annotations.</para>

      <note>
        <para>Generally, better designed domain classes lead to simpler and more efficient score constraints. Therefore,
        when dealing with a messy legacy system, it can sometimes be worth it to convert the messy domain set into a
        planner specific POJO set first. For example: if your domain model has 2 <literal>Teacher</literal> instances
        for the same teacher that teaches at 2 different departments, it's hard to write a correct score constraint that
        is constrains a teacher's spare time.</para>

        <para>Alternatively, you can sometimes also introduce <link linkend="cachedProblemFact"><emphasis>a cached
        problem fact</emphasis></link> to enrich the domain model during planning without actually changing it.</para>
      </note>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Planning entity and planning variables</title>

      <section>
        <title>Planning entity</title>

        <para>A planning entity is a JavaBean (POJO) that changes during solving, for example a <literal>Queen</literal>
        that changes to another row. A planning problem has multiple planning entities, for example for a single n
        queens problem, each <literal>Queen</literal> is a planning entity. But there's usually only 1 planning entity
        class, for example the <literal>Queen</literal> class.</para>

        <para>A planning entity class needs to be annotated with the <literal>@PlanningEntity</literal>
        annotation.</para>

        <para>Each planning entity class has 1 or more <emphasis>planning variables</emphasis>. It usually also has 1 or
        more <emphasis>defining</emphasis> properties. For example in n queens, a <literal>Queen</literal> is defined by
        it's <literal>Column</literal> and has a planning variable <literal>Row</literal>. This means that a Queen's
        column never changes during solving, while it's row does change.</para>

        <programlisting>@PlanningEntity
public class Queen {

    private Column column;

    // Planning variables: changes during planning, between score calculations.
    private Row row;

    // ... getters and setters
}</programlisting>

        <para>A planning entity class can have multiple planning variables. For example, a <literal>Lecture</literal> is
        defined by it's <literal>Course</literal> and it's index in that course (because 1 course has multiple
        lectures). Each <literal>Lecture</literal> needs to be scheduled into a <literal>Period</literal> and a
        <literal>Room</literal> so it has 2 planning variables (period and room). For example: the course Mathematics
        has 8 lectures per week, of which the first lecture is Monday morning at 08:00 in room 212.</para>

        <programlisting>@PlanningEntity
public class Lecture {

    private Course course;
    private int lectureIndexInCourse;

    // Planning variables: changes during planning, between score calculations.
    private Period period;
    private Room room;

    // ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>The solver configuration also needs to be made aware of each planning entity class:</para>

        <programlisting>&lt;solver&gt;
  ...
  &lt;planningEntityClass&gt;org.drools.planner.examples.nqueens.domain.Queen&lt;/planningEntityClass&gt;
  ...
&lt;/solver&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>Some uses cases have multiple planning entity classes. For example: route freight and trains into railway
        network arcs, where each freight can use multiple trains over it's journey and each train can carry multiple
        freights per arc. Having multiple planning entity classes directly raises the implementation complexity of your
        use case.</para>

        <note>
          <para><emphasis>Do not create unnecessary planning entity classes.</emphasis> This leads to difficult
          <literal>Move</literal> implementations and slower score calculation.</para>

          <para>For example, do not create a planning entity class to hold the total free time of a teacher, which needs
          to be kept up to date as the <literal>Lecture</literal> planning entities change. Instead, calculate the free
          time in the score constraints and put the result per teacher into a logically inserted score object.</para>

          <para>If historic data needs to be considered too, then create problem fact to hold the historic data up to,
          but <emphasis>not including</emphasis>, the planning window (so it doesn't change when a planning entity
          changes) and let the score constraints take it into account.</para>
        </note>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="planningEntityDifficulty">
        <title>Planning entity difficulty</title>

        <para>Some optimization algorithms work more efficiently if they have an estimation of which planning entities
        are more difficult to plan. For example: in bin packing bigger items are harder to fit, in course scheduling
        lectures with more students are more difficult to schedule and in n queens the middle queens are more
        difficult.</para>

        <para>Therefore, you can set a <literal>difficultyComparatorClass</literal> to the
        <literal>@PlanningEntity</literal> annotation:</para>

        <programlisting>@PlanningEntity(difficultyComparatorClass = CloudAssignmentDifficultyComparator.class)
public class CloudAssignment {
    // ...
}</programlisting>

        <programlisting>public class CloudAssignmentDifficultyComparator implements Comparator&lt;Object&gt; {

    public int compare(Object a, Object b) {
        return compare((CloudAssignment) a, (CloudAssignment) b);
    }

    public int compare(CloudAssignment a, CloudAssignment b) {
        return new CompareToBuilder()
                .append(a.getCloudProcess().getMinimalMultiplicand(), b.getCloudProcess().getMinimalMultiplicand())
                .append(a.getCloudProcess().getId(), b.getCloudProcess().getId())
                .toComparison();
    }

}</programlisting>

        <para>Alternatively, you can also set a <literal>difficultyWeightFactoryClass</literal> to the
        <literal>@PlanningEntity</literal> annotation, so you have access to the rest of the problem facts from the
        solution too:</para>

        <programlisting>@PlanningEntity(difficultyWeightFactoryClass = QueenDifficultyWeightFactory.class)
public class Queen {
    // ...
}</programlisting>

        <programlisting>public interface PlanningEntityDifficultyWeightFactory {

    Comparable createDifficultyWeight(Solution solution, Object planningEntity);

}</programlisting>

        <programlisting>public class QueenDifficultyWeightFactory implements PlanningEntityDifficultyWeightFactory {

    public Comparable createDifficultyWeight(Solution solution, Object planningEntity) {
        NQueens nQueens = (NQueens) solution;
        Queen queen = (Queen) planningEntity;
        int distanceFromMiddle = calculateDistanceFromMiddle(nQueens.getN(), queen.getColumnIndex());
        return new QueenDifficultyWeight(queen, distanceFromMiddle);
    }

    // ...

    public static class QueenDifficultyWeight implements Comparable&lt;QueenDifficultyWeight&gt; {

        private final Queen queen;
        private final int distanceFromMiddle;

        public QueenDifficultyWeight(Queen queen, int distanceFromMiddle) {
            this.queen = queen;
            this.distanceFromMiddle = distanceFromMiddle;
        }

        public int compareTo(QueenDifficultyWeight other) {
            return new CompareToBuilder()
                    // The more difficult queens have a lower distance to the middle
                    .append(other.distanceFromMiddle, distanceFromMiddle) // Decreasing
                    .append(queen.getColumnIndex(), other.queen.getColumnIndex())
                    .toComparison();
        }

    }

}</programlisting>

        <para><emphasis>None of the current planning variable state may be used to compare planning entities.</emphasis>
        They are likely to be <literal>null</literal> anyway. For example, a <literal>Queen</literal>'s
        <literal>row</literal> variable may not be used.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Planning variable</title>

        <para>A planning variable is a property (including getter and setter) on a planning entity. It changes during
        planning. For example, a <literal>Queen</literal>'s <literal>row</literal> property is a planning variable. Note
        that even though a <literal>Queen</literal>'s <literal>row</literal> property changes to another
        <literal>Row</literal> during planning, no <literal>Row</literal> instance itself is changed. A planning
        variable points to a planning value.</para>

        <para>A planning variable getter needs to be annotated with the <literal>@PlanningVariable</literal> annotation.
        Furthermore, it needs a <literal>@ValueRange*</literal> annotation too.</para>

        <programlisting>@PlanningEntity
public class Queen {

    private Row row;

    // ...

    @PlanningVariable
    @ValueRangeFromSolutionProperty(propertyName = "rowList")
    public Row getRow() {
        return row;
    }

    public void setRow(Row row) {
        this.row = row;
    }

}</programlisting>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>When is a planning entity initialized?</title>

        <para>A planning entity is considered initialized if all it's planning variables are initialized.</para>

        <para>By default, a planning variable is considered initialized if it's value is not
        <literal>null</literal>.</para>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Planning value and planning value ranges</title>

      <section>
        <title>Planning value</title>

        <para>A planning value is a possible value for a planning variable. Usually, a planning value is problem fact,
        but it can also be any object, for example a double. Sometimes it can even be another planning entity.</para>

        <para>A planning value range is the set of possible planning values for a planning variable. This set can be a
        discrete (for example row <literal>1</literal>, <literal>2</literal>, <literal>3</literal> or
        <literal>4</literal>) or continuous (for example any <literal>double</literal> between <literal>0.0</literal>
        and <literal>1.0</literal>). There are several ways to define the value range of a planning variable, each with
        it's own <literal>@ValueRange*</literal> annotation.</para>

        <para>If <literal>null</literal> is a valid planning value, it should be included in the value range and the
        default way to detect uninitialized planning variables must be changed.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Planning value range</title>

        <section>
          <title><literal>ValueRangeFromSolutionProperty</literal></title>

          <para>All instances of the same planning entity class share the same set of possible planning values for that
          planning variable. This is the most common way to configure a value range.</para>

          <para>The <literal>Solution</literal> implementation has property which returns a
          <literal>Collection</literal>. Any value from that <literal>Collection</literal> is a possible planning value
          for this planning variable.</para>

          <programlisting>    @PlanningVariable
    @ValueRangeFromSolutionProperty(propertyName = "rowList")
    public Row getRow() {
        return row;
    }</programlisting>

          <programlisting>public class NQueens implements Solution&lt;SimpleScore&gt; {

    // ...

    public List&lt;Row&gt; getRowList() {
        return rowList;
    }

}</programlisting>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title><literal>ValueRangeFromPlanningEntityProperty</literal></title>

          <para>Each planning entity has it's own set of possible planning values for a planning variable. For example,
          if a teacher can <emphasis role="bold">never</emphasis> teach in a room that does not belong to his
          department, lectures of that teacher can limit their room value range to the rooms of his department.</para>

          <programlisting>    @PlanningVariable
    @ValueRangeFromPlanningEntityProperty(propertyName = "possibleRoomList")
    public Room getRoom() {
        return room;
    }

    public List&lt;Room&gt; getPossibleRoomList() {
        return getCourse().getTeacher().getPossibleRoomList();
    }</programlisting>

          <para>Never use this to enforce a soft constraint (or even a hard constraint when the problem might not have a
          feasible solution). For example, when a teacher can not teach in a room that does not belong to his department
          <emphasis>unless there is no other way</emphasis>, the teacher should <emphasis>not</emphasis> be limited in
          his room value range.</para>

          <note>
            <para>By limiting the value range specifically of 1 planning entity, you are effectively making a
            <emphasis>build-in hard constraint</emphasis>. This can be a very good thing, as the number of possible
            solutions is severely lowered. But this can also be a bad thing because it takes away the freedom of the
            optimization algorithms to temporarily break such a hard constraint.</para>
          </note>

          <para>A planning entity should <emphasis>not</emphasis> use other planning entities to determinate it's value
          range. It would only try to solve the planning problem itself and interfere with the optimization
          algorithms.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title><literal>ValueRangeUndefined</literal></title>

          <para>Leaves the value range undefined. Some optimization algorithms do not support this value
          range.<programlisting>    @PlanningVariable
    @ValueRangeUndefinied
    public Row getRow() {
        return row;
    }</programlisting></para>

        <title>Planning value strength</title>

        <para>Some optimization algorithms work more efficiently if they have an estimation of which planning values are
        stronger, which means they are more likely to satisfy a planning entity. For example: in bin packing bigger
        containers are more likely to fit an item and in course scheduling bigger rooms are less likely to break the
        student capacity constraint.</para>

        <para>Therefore, you can set a <literal>strengthComparatorClass</literal> to the
        <literal>@PlanningVariable</literal> annotation:</para>

        <programlisting>    @PlanningVariable(strengthComparatorClass = CloudComputerStrengthComparator.class)
    // ...
    public CloudComputer getCloudComputer() {
        // ...
    }</programlisting>

        <programlisting>public class CloudComputerStrengthComparator implements Comparator&lt;Object&gt; {

    public int compare(Object a, Object b) {
        return compare((CloudComputer) a, (CloudComputer) b);
    }

    public int compare(CloudComputer a, CloudComputer b) {
        return new CompareToBuilder()
                .append(a.getMultiplicand(), b.getMultiplicand())
                .append(b.getCost(), a.getCost()) // Descending (but this is debatable)
                .append(a.getId(), b.getId())
                .toComparison();
    }

}</programlisting>

        <para>Alternatively, you can also set a <literal>strengthWeightFactoryClass</literal> to the
        <literal>@PlanningVariable</literal> annotation, so you have access to the rest of the problem facts from the
        solution too:</para>

        <programlisting>    @PlanningVariable(strengthWeightFactoryClass = RowStrengthWeightFactory.class)
    // ...
    public Row getRow() {
        // ...

        <programlisting>public interface PlanningValueStrengthWeightFactory {

    Comparable createStrengthWeight(Solution solution, Object planningValue);

}</programlisting>

        <programlisting>
public class RowStrengthWeightFactory implements PlanningValueStrengthWeightFactory {

    public Comparable createStrengthWeight(Solution solution, Object planningValue) {
        NQueens nQueens = (NQueens) solution;
        Row row = (Row) planningValue;
        int distanceFromMiddle = calculateDistanceFromMiddle(nQueens.getN(), row.getIndex());
        return new RowStrengthWeight(row, distanceFromMiddle);
    }

    // ...

    public static class RowStrengthWeight implements Comparable&lt;RowStrengthWeight&gt; {

        private final Row row;
        private final int distanceFromMiddle;

        public RowStrengthWeight(Row row, int distanceFromMiddle) {
            this.row = row;
            this.distanceFromMiddle = distanceFromMiddle;
        }

        public int compareTo(RowStrengthWeight other) {
            return new CompareToBuilder()
                    // The stronger rows have a lower distance to the middle
                    .append(other.distanceFromMiddle, distanceFromMiddle) // Decreasing (but this is debatable)
                    .append(row.getIndex(), other.row.getIndex())
                    .toComparison();
        }

    }

        <para><emphasis>None of the current planning variable state in any of the planning entities may be used to

      <title>Planning problem and planning solution</title>

      <section>
        <title>Planning problem instance</title>

        <para>A dataset for a planning problem needs to be wrapped in a class for the <literal>Solver</literal> to
        solve. You must implement this class. For example in n queens, this in the <literal>NQueens</literal> class
        which contains a <literal>Column</literal> list, a <literal>Row</literal> list and a <literal>Queen</literal>
        list.</para>

        <para>A planning problem is actually a unsolved planning solution or - stated differently - an uninitialized
        <literal>Solution</literal>. Therefor, that wrapping class must implement the <literal>Solution</literal>
        interface. For example in n queens, that <literal>NQueens</literal> class implements
        <literal>Solution</literal>, yet every <literal>Queen</literal> in a fresh <literal>NQueens</literal> class is
        assigned to a <literal>Row</literal> yet. So it's not a feasible solution. It's not even a possible solution.
        It's an uninitialized solution.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>The <literal>Solution</literal> interface</title>

        <para>You need to present the problem as a <literal>Solution</literal> instance to the
        <literal>Solver</literal>. So you need to have a class that implements the <literal>Solution</literal>
        interface:</para>

        <programlisting language="java">public interface Solution&lt;S extends Score&gt; {

    S getScore();
    void setScore(S score);

    Collection&lt;? extends Object&gt; getProblemFacts();

    Solution&lt;S&gt; cloneSolution();

}</programlisting>

        <para>For example, an <literal>NQueens</literal> instance holds a list of all columns, all rows and all
        <literal>Queen</literal> instances:</para>

        <programlisting language="java">public class NQueens implements Solution&lt;SimpleScore&gt; {

    private int n;

    // Problem facts
    private List&lt;Column&gt; columnList;
    private List&lt;Row&gt; rowList;

    // Planning entities
    private List&lt;Queen&gt; queenList;

    // ...
}</programlisting>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>The getScore and setScore methods</title>

        <para>A <literal>Solution</literal> requires a score property. The score property is <literal>null</literal> if
        the <literal>Solution</literal> is uninitialized or if the score has not yet been (re)calculated. The score
        property is usually typed to the specific <literal>Score</literal> implementation you use. For example,
        <literal>NQueens</literal> uses a <literal>SimpleScore</literal>:</para>

        <programlisting language="java">public class NQueens implements Solution&lt;SimpleScore&gt; {

    private SimpleScore score;

    public SimpleScore getScore() {
        return score;
    }

    public void setScore(SimpleScore score) {
        this.score = score;
    }

    // ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>Most use cases use a <literal>HardAndSoftScore</literal> instead:</para>

        <programlisting>public class CurriculumCourseSchedule implements Solution&lt;HardAndSoftScore&gt; {

    private HardAndSoftScore score;

    public HardAndSoftScore getScore() {
        return score;
    }

    public void setScore(HardAndSoftScore score) {
        this.score = score;
    }

    // ...

      <section xml:id="getProblemFacts">
        <title>The getProblemFacts method</title>

        <para>All objects returned by the <literal>getProblemFacts()</literal> method will be asserted into the drools
        working memory, so the score rules can access them. For example, <literal>NQueens</literal> just returns all

        <title>Cached problem fact</title>

        <para>A cached problem fact is a problem fact that doesn't exist in the real domain model, but is calculated

        the chance to enrich the domain model with such cached problem facts, which can lead to simpler and faster score
        constraints.</para>

        <para>For example in examination, a cache problem fact <literal>TopicConflict</literal> is created for every 2

    <section>
      <title>Environment mode</title>

      <para>The environment mode allows you to detect common bugs in your implementation.</para>

      <para>You can set the environment mode in the solver configuration XML file:</para>

      <programlisting language="xml">&lt;solver&gt;
  &lt;environmentMode&gt;DEBUG&lt;/environmentMode&gt;
  ...
&lt;/solver&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>A solver has a single <literal>Random</literal> instance. Some solver configurations use the
      <literal>Random</literal> instance a lot more than others. For example simulated annealing depends highly on
      random numbers, while tabu search only depends on it to deal with score ties. The environment mode influences the
      seed of that <literal>Random</literal> instance.</para>

      <para>There are 4 environment modes:</para>

      <section>
        <title>TRACE</title>

        <para>The trace mode is reproducible (see the reproducible mode) and also turns on all assertions (such as
        assert that the delta based score is uncorrupted) to fail-fast on rule engine bugs.</para>

        <para>The trace mode is very slow (because it doesn't rely on delta based score calculation).</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>DEBUG</title>

        <para>The debug mode is reproducible (see the reproducible mode) and also turns on most assertions (such as
        assert that the undo Move is uncorrupted) to fail-fast on a bug in your Move implementation, your score rule,
        ...</para>

        <para>The debug mode is slow.</para>

        <para>It's recommended to write a test case which does a short run of your planning problem with debug mode
        on.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>REPRODUCIBLE (default)</title>

        <para>The reproducible mode is the default mode because it is recommended during development. In this mode, 2
        runs on the same computer will execute the same code in the same order. They will also yield the same result,
        except if they use a time based termination and they have a sufficiently large difference in allocated CPU time.
        This allows you to benchmark new optimizations (such as a score constraint change) fairly.</para>

        <para>The reproducible mode is not much slower than the production mode.</para>

        <para>In practice, this mode uses the default random seed, and it also disables certain concurrency
        optimizations (such as work stealing).</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>PRODUCTION</title>

        <para>The production mode is the fastest and the most robust, but not reproducible. It is recommended for a

        <para>The random seed is different on every run, which makes it more robust against an unlucky random seed. An
        unlucky random seed gives a bad result on a certain data set with a certain solver configuration. Note that in
        most use cases the impact of the random seed is relatively low on the result (even with simulated annealing). An
        occasional bad result is far more likely caused by another issue (such as a score trap).</para>
