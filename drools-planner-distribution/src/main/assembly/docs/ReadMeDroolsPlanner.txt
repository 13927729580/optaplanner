Run the examples

It's easy to run the examples:

  examples/runExamples.sh
On Windows:
  examples\runExamples.bat

Read the reference manual
-------------------------

To see the reference_manual, just open:

It contains information how to use it on your project (with Maven, ANT, ...).

Known problems
--------------

Drools Planner is not backward compatible with previous versions
and future versions might not be backward compatible either,
but the upgrade recipe (UpgradeFromPreviousVersionRecipe.txt) makes it easy
to upgrade your code to every new version as they are released.
